Two scripts available

classifier.py - tags and summarises in two steps. Retrieves notams from the DINS endpoint by station ID and notam ID

tag_notam.py - tags and summarises in one step. Retrieves notams from the ICAO endpoint (which is a wrapper for DINS anyway). Retrieves notams based on station ID only.
  - Saves a json file (a list of dicts) with each notam having one dictionary with the keys: notam_id, tags, 7_word_summary, body, raw_text, station

Neither file has any saving to database logic
