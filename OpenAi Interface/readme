Two scripts available

classifier.py - tags and summarises in two steps. Retrieves notams from the DINS endpoint by station ID and notam ID

tag_notam.py - tags and summarises in one step. Retrieves notams from the ICAO endpoint (which is a wrapper for DINS anyway). Retrieves notams based on station ID only.

Neither file has any saving to database logic

Next steps:
  - Will need to also store the raw notam after it is retrieved from the notam source
  - Then marry the tag and summary with the raw notam text
  - Then save to a database
  
Next next steps:
  - Make PDF
